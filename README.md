# cgol
This version is still not ready for usage.

## Installation
First make sure you have Go installed, GOPATH configured, etc.

To install just run `go get github.com/runaphox/cgol`.

You can now run the simulation by typing `cgol` in directly in your terminal,
assuming you have your $PATH set to look inside $GOPATH/bin.
